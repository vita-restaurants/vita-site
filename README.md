This is an assignment for The Iron Yard - Minneapolis front end development program
Andrew Lentz and Sam Pellegrene designed the website for a fictional club in Minneapolis.
The initial design for the website can be seen [here](https://www.figma.com/file/LDkO9TKMRLO62u7ZkEzYp78L/Untitled)

We wanted to align our site with the flashy aesthetic found in many modern day venues while also maintaining a clean and organized user experience.

The site was built using a mobile-first approach, and was made fully dynamic with the use of flexbox.
